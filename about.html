            <b>SPOILER ALERT!</b>
            <br>Originaly, Sword Art Online is a manga, but this website refers on the anime. The story is about a boy getting caught in a <b>virtual reality mmorpg</b> (vrmmorpg) along with about 10000 other people. The goal is to finish the game by fighting
            through 100 levels and beating every boss. The ultimate virtual reality was created in the moment the only gamemaster and creator of the game teleported all players into the first city to anounce, that you wont be able to logout or die in
            the game, otherwise you will die in reality. Finaly the boy won the game and saved all the people remaining. On this journey he found his big love and together they had to solve many problems even after ending Sword Art Online.
